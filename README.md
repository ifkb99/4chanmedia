Requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), preferably at least 3.7. Make sure you check the add to $PATH box when installing
## Simple CL Use
```python thread_downloader.py THREAD_LINK (optional: folder name)```
You may have to type python3 or py instead of python. Try all three before you ask for help

## How to use
- Clone/download this repo to wherever you want to use it
- Open a command window in the folder (Shift+Right-click -> open command window here)
- Type what you see in the use case above, substiuting the THREAD_LINK and folder name if you wish (tab can be used to autocomplete filenames)
- If a thread does not have a title, you will get a message that the thread has already been downloaded. Type n, then try again but supply a folder name (you can hit up on the keyboard to have the cmdline retype the command for you)
